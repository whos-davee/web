                excellence, and contribute to a prosperous Philippines. The foundation serves as an extended family,

            <h2>
                HISTORY
              </h2>
            <p class="text">The foundation started as a promise. A promise of commitment eventually grew and helped lots of young, 
                determined, intelligent individuals of Cebu. The year was 1983 when a European went to the Philippines 
                and chose Cebu as his point of destination.
                <br>
                He was a government doctor who specialized in the care and treatment of problem youths in parts of Europe.
                During his stay in the country, among many other people he met a boy. Inspired by the boy's dedication, 
                he helped him continue his studies and fulfill his dreams. Through time, the family of scholars expanded 
                and the promise went on in the name of Kff Foundation.</p>
